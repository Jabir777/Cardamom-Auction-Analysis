# Cardamom Auction Price Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes cardamom auction price behavior in India using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The objective is to understand price volatility, seasonal patterns, and the relationship between supply-demand variables and price.

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- Time-Series Analysis
- Regression Modeling
- Business Insights & Storytelling

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
✔ Auction-wise price trend  
✔ Monthly and weekly time-series analysis  
✔ Rolling mean for smoother trends  
✔ Volatility using rolling standard deviation  
✔ Linear Regression for price prediction  

## 📊 Major Insights
- A large price spike observed during **2019–2020**, driven by supply shortage & high export demand.
- Noticeable **seasonal behavior** with price peaks around Nov–Jan.
- Price volatility remains **high**, indicating an unpredictable market.
